# 1. Do you have Production experience with Node prior to the submission of this code challenge? if yes, for how long?
    I have had production work experience with other backend environments including Django but not with Node Js. 
    However, I do have Node.js and Express.js experience from schooling for a year in which I was involved in projects to create web applications that utilized Node.js and Express.
    One of these projects included a web applicaton utilizing Node, Express, Mustache, and MongoDb which organized a database for movies and provided the user with a way to sort, rate, remove, add
    and view movies along with specific details. 

# 2. Do you have production experience with React prior to the submission of this code challenge? If yes, for how long?
    Yes, I have had production work expereinece with REACT for 8 months. In my previous experience as Jr Programmer for the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long Term Care,
    I utilized react to create a fullstack web application, with the backend framework being Django. The Backend communicates with an Oracle SQL Database to retrieve data, inject metadata in excel forms, generate SQL scripts, and create compressed packages which are utilized by another public facing production java springboot web application.
